# smart_task

Ruby script that reads a log file containing routes and their visitors ip and orders them.

Meant for the hiring process of Smart Pension.

# How to use

To run the script you must pass the path to the log as an argument:

~~~
./ruby_app/services/parse_smartly webserver.log
~~~

This should return ordered lists with the pages with most views and most unique views.

# Possible improvements

- Validate log data: invalid ips, invalid routes. Add specific exceptions to each. E.g.: SyntaxError, 'Invalid ip'
- Optimize the reading process for big files, possibly by splitting and processing in chunks.Ã±
- Further add test cases. e.g.: mp4 file changed to .log extension.
- Save the script response somewhere (DB, txt file).
- Improve the SmartLog class with methods to process its @result attribute.
